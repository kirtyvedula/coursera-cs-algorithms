C++ implementation of algorithms and data structures from "Algorithms Part1" course from coursera.org
======================

Here I'm going to collect algorithms and data structures described in Algorithms Part1 course
for coursera.org(https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-003/class/index) implemented in
C++(Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick uses Java in the course). Please do not use code from this
repository as cheat in excersises from course. Keep in mind: main purpose of the code in the
repository is to help you to review the course.
